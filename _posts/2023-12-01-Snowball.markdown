Computer graphics project on our own C++ game engine

### Computer graphics centered project

Group project with Girard Antoine, Axel Joly and Larsonneur Ugo

1. Implemented our own C++ engine on an existing basis
2. PhysX integration 
3. Multiple post-effect implementation

### A Racing game!

Our goal was to create a physics-based racing game using PhysX and to implement various post effects using the DirectX11 render pipeline.

### Post effect with DirectX 11

* Depth of field
* Vignette 
* Speed lines
* Radial blur
* Snow rendering with noise

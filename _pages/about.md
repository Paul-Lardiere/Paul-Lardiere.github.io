Passionate about video games since childhood, I developed a strong interest in computer science early on. After two years of preparatory classes, where I studied a significant amount of math and physics, I entered Polytech'Tours where I specialized in Architecture and Systems, focusing on low-level programming (C, C++, and CUDA), operating systems, and multithreaded computing.

For my final year of engineering school, I had the opportunity to pursue a double degree in Montreal at Université de Sherbrooke, where I enrolled in the DDJV (Diplôme d'études supérieures spécialisées de 2e cycle en développement du jeu vidéo) program.

During this year, I studied Infography, AI for video games, and significantly improved my C++ skills thanks to my professor Patrice Roy. I also delved into math and physics as applied to video games and participated in two major group projects, which are presented in my portfolio. Many of our instructors were industry professionals from the Montreal video game scene, and we had the chance to visit studios like Eidos, Ubisoft, and Panache. We also received specialized instruction in AI, Infography, UI, sound design from guest speakers working in the industry.

I have a deep interest in low-level programming and optimization and aspire to work as an engine developer in the video game industry!
